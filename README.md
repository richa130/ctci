# Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition

Going through CTCI to work on my Java/DSA skills. Although I want to prep for coding interviews, I also want to fully understand/master Java. I like to keep track of my progress, so here's a bit about what I learned from each chapter:

## Chapter 1: Arrays and Strings
* A string in Java is a datatype. Unlike some other languages, it is not an array of chars but an **actual object**
* When you create a string, you are creating a pointer to some string object in memory. When a string variable is reassigned, a whole new string object is being created. This is what it means to say **strings are immutable**
* String.format() is another way to concatenate and format strings in Java (similar to printf() in C!)
* The notation **String x = "...";** is a shorthand for declaring a string, and is exactly the same as using the **new** keyword to declare a string
